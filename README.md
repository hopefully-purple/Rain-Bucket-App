## The Idea
### Origin: The 'Rain Bucket' Concept

Every year in high school, my Spanish teacher would pass out mini Composition notebooks to use as 'rain buckets'. These were meant to be kept on hand wherever we went. If we learned a new word or phrase, we could write it down in the mini notebook, like collecting raindrops in a bucket.

Later, in my college years, I started using the Notes app on my phone as my rainbucket, but quickly became frustrated with the limitations of the app. My lists had grown so long, it took forever to scroll to the word I wanted, and looking through every definition to find a word I forgot was tedious. I searched for apps and language tools that would provide a searchable rain bucket of sorts, but nothing was as simple and as customizable as I wanted. So I took matters into my own hands!

## Features

The Rain Bucket App provides a way for users to make customizable lists of words and phrases for the languages they are learning. Users can search for words or definitions that they save, create tags for organization, add notes to definitions for pronunciation reminders or tricks on memorizing. This elevates the Composition notebook experience by placing the rain bucket into your phone, an object everyone already has on hand.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
